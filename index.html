      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Basic program structure</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">RobotC programs are basically a sequence of statements that the computer (NXT) will run. Whitespace doesn't matter.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">The next statement doesn't start until the previous statement finishes, unless you explicitly say otherwise.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">There are two types of statements: command statements, and flow control statements</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Command statements</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Command statements are basically <em>actions</em>. They <em>do</em> something, like initializing a variable or moving a motor.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Command statements are terminated by <code>;</code>s.</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Control flow statements</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Control flow statements control the <em>flow</em> of the program (semi-obviously).</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For example, the <code>if</code> statement controls whether or not a collection of statements run, based on a condition.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Control flow statements look like this: <code>statement (parameter) { action; action; action; }</code></h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Let's just look at an example.</h3>
      </section>
      <section data-bespoke-backdrop="emphatic">
        <pre><code>// declare (initialize) a variable
bool continue = true;
&nbsp;
while (continue)
{
 /*
  this is a contrived example. usually you would
  just put `someVariable <= 5` in the while loop.
 */
 if (someVariable <= 5)
 {
  continue = false;
 }
}
</code></pre>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Common control flow statements</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet"><code>if (condition) {}</code></h3>
        <h3 class="bullet"><code>while (condition) {}</code></h3>
        <h3 class="bullet"><code>for (initialCommand; condition; endCommand) {}</code></h3>
      </section>

        <h1>Ancillary concepts</h1>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Application code</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">This is a fancy term for situation-specific code.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Application code is code that contains the logic specific to whatever problem you're trying to solve.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For example, a robot's teliop, or a particular autonomous routine.</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">Libraries</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">A library is a unit of code that's designed to be reused.</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Libraries cannot be compiled on their own, instead, application programs use them</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Libraries are good because they reduce code duplication, which means less work for everyone</h3>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2 class="bullet">APIs</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">An API, or Application Programming Interface, is a collection of command statements that works with a certain topic</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">For example: "the motors API"</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">If you want to seriously program with RobotC you will want to use the <a href="https://github.com/saasrobotics/Libraries">APIs that we have written</a></h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">If you just want to move a prototype's motors, you'll want to use the RobotC APIs. See <a href="http://www.robotc.net/wiki/NXT_Motors_and_Servos_Overview">motors and servos</a> on the RobotC wiki</h3>

        <h2 class="bullet">Things I haven't covered</h2>
        <h3 class="bullet">Functions</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Variable types</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">Conditionals</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet"><code>#includes</code></h3>
        <h3 class="bullet"><code>switch</code> statements</h3>
        <h3 class="bullet">I don't want to take up too much time with these, but if they interest you, talk to me! I'll teach you about them.</h3>
